The Research Problem
====================

Antimicrobial resistance is a major healthcare problem worldwide (WHO 2014a). Patients with antimicrobial resistant infections are more likely to be at risk of worse clinical outcomes, recurrent infection, and death, than infected patients without antimicrobial resistance (AMR) (Huttner et al. 2013). In addition, AMR creates a massive financial burden to healthcare systems (WHO 2011b). Many factors influence the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance worldwide, and in Thailand in particular. These factors include the availability of antimicrobial medicines without prescription, inappropriate prescribing of antimicrobial medicines by medical practitioners and inappropriate practices related to prevention and control of the spread of AMR (Moongtui, Picheansathian & Senaratana 2011). Antimicrobial stewardship is important to ensure optimal antimicrobial medicine use and minimize antimicrobial resistance (MacDougall & Polk E. 2005). A multidisciplinary approach is considered best practice in antimicrobial stewardship (Lin et al. 2013), however not all antimicrobial stewardship programs include nurses (Edwards et al. 2011b). Nurses are the largest group of healthcare professionals and are the only healthcare professionals with patients 24 hours a day in acute care environments (Mensik 2014). Nurses are therefore in a unique position to educate patients and family regarding safe use of antimicrobial medicines, ensure evidence-based administration of antimicrobial medicines, monitor the effectiveness of antimicrobial medicines, identify unnecessary antimicrobial medicines and contribute to multidisciplinary plans of care (Edwards et al. 2011b; Galvin & Fennell 2012; Gillespie et al. 2013a; Ladenheim et al. 2013a; Lim 2010; Storr 2012).

Although nurses may not be direct prescribers of antibiotics, they have the potential to influence the prescription and use of medicines by monitoring prescription decisions (Castledine 2006; Jutel & Menkes 2010a) and ongoing therapy. In addition, actively educating patients is a key strategy in reducing antimicrobial resistance to which nurses can make a major contribution (WHO 2014a). Despite the important role that nurses may play in the safe and effective use of antibiotics, little is known about nursesâ€™ contribution to antimicrobial stewardship (Edwards et al. 2011c). In particular, the current and potential role of nurses in antimicrobial stewardship in Thailand needs further investigation in order to understand how nurses can contribute to safe use of antimicrobial medicines and reduction in AMR.
